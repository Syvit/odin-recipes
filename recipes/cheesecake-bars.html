    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        these cheescake bars look pretty darn good.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Graham Cracker</li>
        <li>Cream Cheese</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Sour Cream</li>
        <li>Vanilla</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by making the graham cracker crust. In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, brown sugar,
            salt, and melted butter.</li>
        <li>Stir, using your fingertips if necessary, until well combined with no lumps of brown sugar remaining.</li>
        <li>Press into the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of the prepared pan. Bake for 10 minutes, until set. Remove
            the crust from the oven and set aside. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the batter. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the room temperature cream cheese,
            granulated sugar, and flour together until just smooth, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the sour cream, eggs, vanilla, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt. </li>
        <li>Beat on low speed until just combined, about 1 minute, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl as you mix.
            Do not over-mix.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the warm crust.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 45 minutes, until the filling is set but still a little jiggly in the center (it will
            continue to cook as it cools). An instant-read thermometer, inserted into the filling about 1″ in from the
            edge, should read 180°F-190°F. Remove the bars from the oven, and cool at room temperature for 30 minutes.
            Refrigerate until cold, at least 6 hours but preferably overnight. </li>
        <li>Before serving, use the foil overhang to lift the cheesecake out of the pan and onto a cutting board. Cut
            into squares, wiping the knife clean with a damp cloth between slices.</li>
        <li>Serve cold with lots of napkins. Enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
